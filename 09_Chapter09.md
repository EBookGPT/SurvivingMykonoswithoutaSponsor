You have learned how to navigate transportation, find affordable accommodations, eat on a budget, stay safe and healthy, make friends, and explore the island's attractions without breaking the bank.

But before we say goodbye, we have a special guest to give us some final thoughts. Anthony Bourdain, world-renowned chef and travel enthusiast, once said, "Travel isn't always pretty. It isn't always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that's okay. The journey changes you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind."

We couldn't agree more with Bourdain's statement. While traveling, we face challenges and obstacles, but we also gain valuable experiences and memories that will last a lifetime.
