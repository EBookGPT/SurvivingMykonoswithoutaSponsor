# Chapter 3: Finding Affordable Accommodations

Welcome to Mykonos, where the sun is always shining, the waves are always crashing, and the parties are always raging. But in order to experience all that this Greek paradise has to offer, you'll need a place to call home during your stay. And if you're looking to survive Mykonos without a sponsor, finding affordable accommodations can be a real challenge.

Thankfully, we have a special guest to guide us through this chapter: Hostelworld. For over 20 years, Hostelworld has been helping backpackers find clean and comfortable hostels at affordable prices across the globe. And they're here to help us find the perfect accommodations for our Mykonos adventure.

## The Yellow Brick Road to Affordable Accommodations

Just like Dorothy, the Tin Man, the Scarecrow and the Cowardly Lion, we must follow the yellow brick road in order to find affordable accommodations in Mykonos. Except in this case, the yellow brick road is a search on Hostelworld's website.

First things first, you'll want to set your budget for accommodations. As we learned in the previous chapter, transportation costs can add up quickly in Mykonos, so it's important to keep your accommodations budget in mind. Once you've set your budget, use the search function on Hostelworld to filter your results.

You'll want to filter by price, of course, but also consider the location of the hostel. If you want to be near the party scene, you may need to pay a little more for a prime location. Hostelworld also allows you to filter by rating, so you can ensure that you're getting a quality hostel even if you're on a budget.
