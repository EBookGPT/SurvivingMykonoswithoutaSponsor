Welcome to the chapter on making friends and socializing in Mykonos, where we will explore the challenges and opportunities of connecting with locals and fellow travelers alike. While solo travel can be liberating, there is no denying the importance of building meaningful relationships in a foreign place. After all, the locals are the ones who can truly show you the hidden gems and insider tips of Mykonos. 

However, before we jump into the deep end of socializing, we need to address some practical concerns. As mentioned in the previous chapter, staying safe and healthy should always be a priority. So, before heading out to paint the town red, make sure you are taking care of yourself and being mindful of your surroundings. 

Once you have the basics covered, it's time to get social. One of the best ways to meet new people in Mykonos is by attending events or activities that align with your interests. Whether it's a yoga class or a beach volleyball game, participating in something you enjoy is a great way to connect with like-minded individuals.
