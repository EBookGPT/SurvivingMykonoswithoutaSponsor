Welcome back, travelers! We hope you've enjoyed our last chapter on exploring Mykonos on a budget. Now, it's time to say goodbye to this beautiful island. But before you leave, we have some insider tips and tricks to make your departure as smooth as possible.

Joining us for this chapter is our special guest, Rick Steves, the travel expert and bestselling author. Rick has extensive experience traveling the world on a budget and has visited Greece numerous times. We are thrilled to have him share his insights on navigating your way through Mykonos airport and finding the most affordable flights.

### Packing and Getting to the Airport

Before you head to the airport, make sure to double-check your packing. The last thing you want is to be charged extra fees for overweight luggage or have to leave something behind. According to Rick, the key is to pack light and pack smart. "Pack versatile items that can be mixed and matched, and don't forget to leave some extra room for souvenirs," he advises.

Next, let's talk about getting to the airport. Taxis can be expensive on the island, so it's best to use public transportation whenever possible. "Plan ahead and research the bus schedules," suggests Rick. "It's the most budget-friendly way to get to the airport."

### Navigating the Airport

Once you've arrived at the airport, it's important to know what to expect. Mykonos airport can be quite hectic during the peak season, so be prepared for crowds and long lines. "Make sure to give yourself plenty of time," warns Rick. "You don't want to miss your flight because you didn't account for the chaos at the airport."

Also, keep in mind that there are limited food and shopping options at the airport, so make sure to grab a bite to eat before you arrive. "Bring snacks and a reusable water bottle to save money on food and drinks," suggests Rick.

### Finding Affordable Flights

Now, let's talk about finding the most affordable flights. "It's all about being flexible with your travel dates," advises Rick. "Try using a fare aggregator website to compare prices, and consider traveling during the off-peak season."

Additionally, Rick recommends signing up for email alerts from airlines and using credit card rewards programs to save money on flights. "Every little bit helps when you are traveling on a tight budget," he explains.

### Conclusion

As your adventure comes to a close, we hope these tips and tricks will make your departure from Mykonos an easy and stress-free experience. And don't forget to take advantage of all the money-saving strategies that Rick has shared with us. From all of us at Surviving Mykonos without a Sponsor, safe travels and happy trails!
