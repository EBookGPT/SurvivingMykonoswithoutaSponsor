# Wizard of Oz Parable: Finding Budget-Friendly Eats in Mykonos

Our protagonist, Dorothy, had been wandering the yellow brick road for days, feeling hungry and drained. She had heard many tales of the wonderful, lavish feasts that awaited her in the kingdom of Mykonos, but as a budget-conscious traveler, she knew she had to be careful.

Suddenly, she heard a rustling in the bushes ahead of her. As she approached, she saw a group of tiny, colorful creatures, merrily feasting on a pile of delicious-looking food. Curious, she approached them to inquire about their meal.

The creatures introduced themselves as the Munchkins and welcomed Dorothy to join them for lunch. They explained that they had discovered a secret garden, hidden behind a hill of wildflowers, where an old woman grew the freshest herbs and vegetables.

Using these ingredients, they had prepared a feast of savory stuffed tomatoes, cheesy baked zucchinis, and aromatic lamb skewers, all cooked over an open flame. The best part? The meal was budget-friendly and made with locally-sourced ingredients.

As they ate, the Munchkins shared their tips for finding budget-friendly eats in Mykonos. They advised Dorothy to explore the local markets, where she could find freshly caught fish, ripe fruits, and vegetables at reasonable prices.

They also recommended avoiding the tourist traps and heading to the outskirts of town, where the smaller, family-run restaurants offered authentic Greek food at affordable rates.

Feeling grateful for the Munchkins' sage advice, Dorothy thanked them and continued on her journey. She felt confident and energized, knowing that she had discovered the secret to eating well on a budget in Mykonos.
